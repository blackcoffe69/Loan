## Results

- The prevalent age range among loan defaulters spans from 18 to 69 years old. Individuals at 18 years old may encounter challenges in repayment due to their early career stage, possibly leading to employment instability. Conversely,those aged 69 may face reduced income levels or unemployment, often associated with their advanced age and potentially impacting their ability to meet repayment obligations.

- The analysis of income by employment type reveals that individuals employed part-time have the highest total income, amounting to $5,286,183,558. Following closely are those employed full-time, with a total income of $5,276,464,807, and self-employed individuals with a total income of $5,252,350,046. Despite the lowest rank, unemployed individuals still accumulate a substantial total income of $5,250,951,520.

- The analysis indicates that 88.38% of customers successfully met their loan repayment obligations within their respective loan terms, while 11.61% defaulted on their loans. This delineation effectively highlights the risk factors associated with certain age groups, identifying potential loan defaulters for future considerations.

- The analysis reveals that among our customer base, the mean income is $82,499.31, with a standard deviation of $38,963.01, indicating a commendable level of income stability. The income range spans from $1,500.00 to $149,999.00, reflecting the diversity of our customer base and suggesting the potential for gradual loan recovery over time. Additionally, the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles are $48,825.50, $82,466.00, and $116,219.00, respectively, providing insights into the income distribution among our customers.

- The assessment of marital status by Default indicates that married customers have the lowest count at 8,869, followed by divorced customers at 10,657, and single customers at 10,127. This observation suggests that married individuals have a lower risk of loan default compared to single individuals, who exhibit a higher propensity for default. This insight informs potential considerations for loan approvals based on marital status in the future, with a focus on mitigating risk associated with single customers.

- The analysis of marital status by mortgage status reveals that individuals who are married and have a mortgage (Yes) represent the highest count at 42,728, followed closely by married individuals without a mortgage (No) at 42,574. Among divorced individuals, those without a mortgage (No) have a count of 42,501, while those with a mortgage (Yes) have a count of 42,532. Similarly, among single individuals, those without a mortgage (No) have a count of 42,564, whereas those with a mortgage (Yes) have a count of 42,448.This insight suggests that individuals who are married and have a mortgage demonstrate a lower likelihood of defaulting on loans, while single individuals with a mortgage exhibit a higher risk of default.
